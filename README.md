# Online Image Editor

ðŸš€ **A high-performance, free & open-source browser-based image editor powered by Rust + WebAssembly + React.**

## ðŸŒŸ Features
âœ… RGB, Brightness, Contrast Adjustments  
âœ… Rotate & Blur (5 levels: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10)  
âœ… Color Pop, Grey Scale, Vintage, Vignette, Sepia  
âœ… Color Invert & Reset  

## âš¡ Why Rust + WebAssembly?
Unlike traditional web-based editors that rely on powerful servers, this one **offloads computations to the client**, leveraging Rust + WebAssembly for:
- **5-10x faster** image processing compared to JavaScript  
- **Better memory efficiency** (no garbage collection overhead)  
- **Real-time image manipulations** directly in the browser  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS  
- **Core Processing:** Rust + WebAssembly  

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenges Faced
- **Blur Effect Optimization:** Even with Rust + Wasm, high blur strengths may cause minor lags.  
- **Rust â†” JavaScript Interconversion:** Efficiently handling data between Rust and JS was a challenge.
